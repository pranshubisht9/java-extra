@Configuration annottion is the complete replacement
of xml file

ClassPathXMLApplicationContext -> AnnotationConfigApplicationContext


if more than one packages then we can use like this

@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.masai","com.abc"})


i can apply @Autowired in setter method,constructor n variable
but variable wala best variable for faster.


container will autmate the setter if we use @Autowired at s

bur setter wala @Auterwired is better
